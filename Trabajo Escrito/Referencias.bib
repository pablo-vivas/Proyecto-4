abstract = {This chapter discusses dengue, which is a human disease caused by a virus that is transmitted from one person to another by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Dengue fever (DF), DHF, and DSS are caused by four closely related but antigenically distinct single-stranded RNA viruses (DEN 1, 2, 3, and 4) in the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviridae. All four serotypes cause a range of human disease, including asymptomatic infections; undifferentiated fever; classic DF: an acute febrile illness with headache, body aches, and rash; DHF; and DSS. Sequential infections with different serotypes are possible because infection with one serotype provides lifelong protection from a homologous infection but is only briefly cross-protective against heterologous serotypes. Aedes aegypti appears the most important dengue vector. Other mosquitoes in the subgenus Stegomyia, including Aedes albopictus and Ae. polynesiensis, have been implicated as vectors in jungles and rural habitats. Prevention of dengue is presently dependent on control of Ae. aegypti. Although progress is being made developing dengue vaccines and anti-viral drugs, none are licensed and commercially available, and a vaccine will need to be tetravalent to avoid adverse consequences from immune enhancement. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.
